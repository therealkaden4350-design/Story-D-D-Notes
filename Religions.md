[[Main Gods]] [[Lesser Gods]] 
#### **The Creed of First Light**
[[Aeltherion, the Dawnfather]] 
### Core Tenets

Followers of the Creed believe that **light is not just illumination, but structure, clarity, and divine intent.** The first light at the dawn of time brought not only warmth, but **form to chaos**, **law to nature**, and **purpose to life.**

 **"All light has its source. All laws, their beginning." — The First Edict**

Key beliefs:

- **Creation is sacred**, for it is the act of forming order from void.

- **Laws are divine echoes** of Aeltherion's first command. To defy law is to defy the source.

- **Civilization is the will of the heavens** — to build, to govern, to bring light to wild places.

- **The sun is not merely a star**, but the eye of the Dawnfather, watching, judging, blessing.



###  Temples and Worship

- Called **Lighthalls** or **Sanctuaries of the First Flame**, temples are often placed at the highest or easternmost points in a city.

- At dawn, the faithful face the rising sun and recite the **Morning Litany**, a prayer of clarity, renewal, and justice.

- **Midday sermons** are called **Solar Proclamations**, where clerics read from **The Codex Aureum** — a holy text of parables and laws.

- **Sundown rituals** are solemn, acknowledging the need for vigilance during night and the **eternal return of order**

###  Clergy and Hierarchy

- **Lightbearers** – Local priests and judges who guide communities and interpret the Codex.

- **Solar Sentinels** – Paladin orders who act as warrior-judges.
-  **The First Ordained** – The high council, residing in the **Heliarch Spire**, said to be founded where Aeltherion’s light first touched mortal earth.

- Titles such as **Sunwarden**, **High Clarion**, and **Justicar of the Flame** are common in the hierarchy.


###  Holy Laws and Ethics

The Creed emphasizes:

- **Truth before loyalty**

- **Justice before mercy**

- **Creation over destruction**

- **Discipline over impulse**

- **The many above the self**


Mercy is not weakness, but **only the just may show it.** Forgiveness without accountability is heresy.


### Symbolism

- The primary holy symbol is a **radiant sunburst crowned with twelve stars**, representing the **Twelve Virtues of Civilization**: Clarity, Law, Resolve, Duty, Harmony, Wisdom, Charity, Vigilance, Creation, Humility, Honor, and Aspiration.

- Clerics often wear robes of **white and gold**, with **sunstone or amber inlays**.


### Festivals

- **Day of the First Light** – The new year celebration at midwinter dawn. At this moment, the clergy symbolically “rekindle the sun.”

- **The Edict March** – A ten-day ritual parade of lawgivers and paladins through the capital, reenacting Aeltherion’s first commandments.

- **Trial of Shadows** – A solemn rite performed during eclipses or long nights, reinforcing faith during the absence of light.

#### **The Lunar Loom
[[Virelya, the Moonweaver]] 
The faithful of the Lunar Loom believe that **reality is a tapestry**, and **Virelya weaves its deeper patterns by moonlight.**  
Her followers do not demand answers — they **listen, observe, interpret.**  
They seek meaning in:

- Dreams and sleep

- Coincidences and signs

- Threads of fate

- Silence and shadow

- Moonlight and reflection
### Core Tenets

- **Truth is not always light.** The unknown is not evil — only misunderstood.

- **Magic is a thread drawn from the unseen.** To wield it well is to respect the weaver.

- **Dreams are messages, not illusions.** They are the soul’s whisper, not its wandering.

- **Silence has power.** Speak only what you must. Listen more than you speak.

- **Every life is a thread.** Some are knotted, some are frayed — all have a place in the pattern.
### Places of Worship

- Temples are called **Moonlooms** or **Dreamspires** — quiet sanctuaries often hidden, moonlit, and open to the sky.

- Many are **built around natural pools**, woven silk veils, silver threads, or ancient moonstones.

- Rather than sermons, temples offer **Dream Communion**, guided meditations, and **symbolic storytelling** under the moon.

### Clergy and Roles

Clergy and Roles
• Moonweavers – Priests and priestesses who interpret omens, guide dreams, and speak for Virelya. They often wear veiled hoods, their eyes painted silver.

• Dreambound – Mystics who surrender their waking lives to live permanently within lucid dreamstates. They are believed to walk beside Virelya herself.

• Threadkeepers – Archivists of symbols and visions. They record dreams, metaphors, and prophecies in woven tapestries or silk-scrolls rather than books.

• Silvertouched – Those chosen by Virelya via dreams to serve a greater purpose — prophets, heroes, or cursed figures fated to change the weave.

### Symbols and Rituals

• Holy Symbol: A crescent moon entwined with a silver thread. Sometimes the thread continues down into a larger tapestry.

• Colors: Midnight blue, soft lavender, and pale silver.

• Sacred Materials: Moonstone, spider silk, silver thread, mistwater.

• Offerings: Unspoken prayers tied into knots, silver mirrors placed under moonlight, journals of recorded dreams.

• Rites of Note:
The Silent Vigil – Held on a full moon night. No words are spoken. Worshippers sit in silent meditation, seeking visions.

The Threading – A naming rite where one’s true path is “woven” into a symbolic tapestry. Often performed for children or mages beginning their training.

Dreamwalking – A sacred rite in which a Moonweaver guides a petitioner into a shared lucid dream to uncover buried truth or glimpse fate.

> _“Silver thread, guide my hand.  
> Gentle moon, guard my sleep.  
> Weaver unseen, show what lies between.” 

#### **The Black Maw
[[Nythraxis, the Bound Void (The Sleeping God)]] 
### Core Beliefs

- **All existence is a lie** stitched together by the delusions of the living.

- **Nythraxis is the original state** — the formless, the silent, the boundless. He does not speak because truth cannot be spoken, only understood in madness or silence.

- **Creation was a mistake.** Existence was a rupture. The Black Maw exists to **seal the wound** of reality and return all to **the True Silence**.

- Knowledge is a curse. But **forbidden knowledge**—mad truths that unravel minds—brings the soul closer to **dissolution**, and thus to divine unity with the Void.

### Symbols

A **ring of black teeth** encircling a central **void** or black disc. It represents:

- The **mouth of Nythraxis**, open and waiting.

- The **end of all things**—devouring time, self, law, and thought.

- The illusion of separation: the teeth **pretend to be separate**, but are all part of the same endless hunger.

### Rituals & Practices
#### The Unmaking Rites

- Performed in total silence.

- Followers shed memories, names, or limbs in acts of symbolic self-erasure.

- The most devout voluntarily allow themselves to be sacrificed and **consumed** — metaphorically or literally — in ceremonial “feasts of forgetting.”

#### The Hollow Sermons

- No words are spoken. A high priest, known as a **Mawspeaker**, may stand before the congregation but says nothing.

- Instead, they may show visions through mirrors of obsidian or whisper truths in **dreams or madness**.

- Those who listen too closely often **lose their identity**, becoming _“Echoed”_—shells that drift silently, no longer individuals.
#### Forbidden Tomes

- Books not written in ink but **burned into pages with acid**, blood, or psychic scars.

- Known texts: _The Void Syllable_, _The Maw Between Stars_, _The Weeping Glyphs_, _The Book That Reads You_.

### Temples and Cult Sites

- Rarely resemble buildings. The Black Maw prefers:

- Hollowed-out places: **caves, collapsed cities, sunken temples**.

- Locations where reality is already thin: **leyline collapses, dream-void intersections, cursed ruins.
- No iconography — only dark, featureless altars and **unlit thresholds** that seem to lead nowhere.

### Clergy and Hierarchy

#### The Mawspeaker

- The highest priest. Rarely seen, possibly **faceless**, or **shrouded entirely** in null-cloth (fabric woven from antimagic silk).

- Claims to hear the dreams of Nythraxis.

- Speaks only once every generation, and when they do, **a city often falls** to ruin afterward.

#### The Echoed

- Former priests or followers who have **shed their identities** completely.

- They walk the world without thought or name, **seeding madness and unraveling reality** wherever they linger.

- Sometimes they become **living conduits** to the Bound Void.

#### The Hollowbound

- Agents, spies, cultists embedded within governments, arcane circles, and universities.

- Their mission: to **leak forbidden knowledge**, to push people to despair or obsession, and to **awaken Nythraxis** from within minds.

### Rivalries

- **Aeltherion** (Order & Sun) is seen as the **False Flame**, a tyrant trying to stave off the inevitable.

- **Thalorien** (God of Life or Renewal, perhaps?) is mocked as “the Last Breath that chokes.”

- The Black Maw believes **all gods fear Nythraxis**, because they were born from the **silence he broke**.

### Myths & Prophecies

- One day, the **Chains of the Sleeping God will loosen**, and Nythraxis will awaken. But **he will not roar — he will inhale**, and all of creation will collapse into him.

- The **First Word** was a scream. The **Last Word** will be a whisper.

- In dreams, the faithful are told:

 **“You are not real. But you can return.”**

#### **Path of the Stormforged
[[Thalorien, the Stormforged King]] 
### Core Beliefs

- **Glory is forged through trial.** Strength of character is earned in the fires of war, hardship, and sacrifice.

- **The storm is a blessing**, not a curse—those who rise against it grow strong.

- **Valor is the soul’s finest metal.** To act with courage, to defend one’s brothers and sisters, to fight with honor—that is worship.

- **The gods do not coddle.** They _temper_ you, like steel on the anvil.

### Symbol

A **warhammer striking a mountain**, surrounded by arcs of lightning or etched runes. Sometimes stylized with a **storm cloud as a shield** behind it.

Represents:

- **Impact and resilience**—no mountain cannot be broken, no soul cannot be hardened.

- The **forge of the world**, where storm and stone meet to shape heroes.

### Rituals & Practices

#### The Thunder Oath

- Every warrior who follows Thalorien makes a **sacred oath** before a storm, striking steel to stone and swearing to uphold **valor over victory**.

- Those who break the oath are said to be **struck down by lightning or cursed to hear no thunder again.**


#### The Skyforge Rite

- Performed at mountaintop temples or during great storms.

- Smiths forge weapons under open skies, calling on Thalorien to bless the steel with **the roar of thunder and the heat of fire**.

- The resulting weapons are believed to carry a **spark of the Stormforged King’s power.**

#### The Brotherhood of Battle

- Followers train together, fight together, and **bleed together**, believing camaraderie and shared pain forge eternal bonds.
    
- No worship is more sacred than **saving a comrade’s life** or standing one's ground when all seems lost.

### Clergy and Structure

#### Storm-Priests

- Warriors blessed by thunder, often loud, charismatic leaders of armies or militias.

- Wear **armor inscribed with lightning runes**, and wield warhammers or axes.

- Preach through **action**, not sermons—charging into battle ahead of their flock.


#### Forge-Singers

- Clerics and smith-priests who craft legendary weapons and recite **battle-chants** during forging and war.

- Believe in **song as a weapon**, using chants to inspire troops and invoke Thalorien’s strength.


#### Oathbringers

- Wandering champions who test the valor of others through duels, challenges, and heroic deeds.

- Some serve as judges in disputes of honor; others seek to **restore courage** to broken hearts.

### Enemies and Philosophical Clashes

- **Kharzun, the Dread Serpent** is the eternal foe—symbol of cowardice, treachery, and unnatural manipulation.

- **Aeltherion, the Dawnfather**, is both rival and ally:

- Thalorien views him as **too rigid, too lofty**, a lawgiver who forgets the battlefield.

- They often fight side by side against darkness but argue fiercely over **order vs. freedom**, **justice vs. valor**.

### Temples and Sacred Sites

- Built into **mountains, high cliffs, or storm-battered coastlines**.

- Many temples double as **training halls or forges**.

- The **Grand Anvil of Stormspire** is said to be struck by lightning every time a new hero is born under Thalorien’s blessing.

### Scripture and Sayings

There are no holy books—**deeds are the scripture**. But warrior-poets and smiths have preserved _The Saga of the Stormforged_, a growing oral epic detailing Thalorien’s battles and the deeds of his greatest followers.

**Common Scriptures/sayings include:

- “Stand like stone. Strike like storm.”

- “Better to die with honor than live in chains.”

- “Steel sings loudest when thunder calls.” _(Sacred proverb)_

- “No storm lasts forever—but the forged do.”

#### **The Quiet Thread
[[Sythira, Lady of Threads]] 
### Core Beliefs

- **All lives are threads in the Loom of Fate**, spun by Sythira’s hand. She does not command life, only **guides it to its destined end** with mercy and grace.

- **Death is not to be feared**—it is merely the return to the source. A final, peaceful breath in the arms of the divine.

- **Time is a spiral, not a line.** What has ended may begin again, in ways unseen.

- To intervene in fate too harshly—especially with violence—is a **sacrilege**.

- **Mercy is strength**, and every act of kindness strengthens the weave of the world.
### Symbolism

**Main Symbol:**  
A **spinning wheel**, its threads curling into a **broken hourglass**—representing that **time is limited**, but the way it ends **can be gentle**.

Alternate motifs include:

- A **silver thread winding through stars**

- A **hand holding scissors**, paused before the cut

- A **grave wrapped in flowers and silk**

### Rituals & Practices

#### The Last Vigil

- At deathbeds, followers chant quiet prayers called **"Threadsongs"**, asking Sythira to **soften the soul’s final hour**.

- They offer **a white thread tied around the wrist** to represent the life passing gently into her hands.

#### The Cradle and the Grave

- Midwives and grave-keepers both serve her, believing birth and death are **mirrored thresholds** in the great weave.

- Newborns are swaddled in **silken cloth**, and the dead are wrapped in **unbleached linen**, both acts of reverence.

#### Loom Vigils

- Monasteries keep spinning wheels in silent rooms where monks meditate on the passage of time, **spinning thread** as symbolic prayers.

- The thread is later woven into **funeral shrouds, prayer ropes, or mercy garments** for the sick and dying.

#### The Mercy Cut

- Clerics may end suffering through **ritual euthanasia**—always with consent, always as a last resort.

- The scissors used are **ceremonially blessed** and never used for anything else.

### Clergy and Devotees

- Known for their **gray robes**, **silver-threaded hoods**, and a quiet presence in any room.

#### Fatescribes

- Seers who record **omens, deaths, and births** in great books of thread-bound pages.

- Often speak cryptically, hinting at fate without revealing it fully.

#### Mercy Weavers

- Itinerant followers who travel to bring **comfort to the grieving**, perform last rites, or **mediate conflicts** before they turn deadly.

### Enemies and Philosophy

- **Thalorien** is her rival for his refusal to bow to destiny—his reckless heroism **tears threads prematurely**, earning her ire.

- **Nythraxis** seeks to **unravel the entire tapestry**, replacing destiny with chaos and oblivion—he is **her greatest antithesis**.

- She holds **no hatred**, only a quiet, enduring sadness for those who rage against the inevitable.

### Sacred Texts & Sayings

Sythira’s religion has no strict dogma. Instead, her faith is passed through **poetry, lullabies, death songs, and meditative reflections**.

#### **The Saltmother's Embrace
[[Lorrakai, the Stormmother]] 
### Core Beliefs 
The sea is not just water, but the living spirit of Lorrakai herself—wild, eternal, and unbound. 

She gives life through the rain and the bounty of the waves, yet takes it back without warning. 

Every storm, every tide is her voice, and those who live by the water must honor her moods. 

Death by sea is not a tragedy, but a return to her embrace.

### Tenets

- Respect the water, whether calm or raging.

- Offer part of every catch or harvest back to the waves.

- Never turn away a sailor in need—hospitality is the sea’s law.

- Accept change, for tides never rest.

### Symbols & Rituals

- Many have ritual tattoos of waves, kelp, or the open eye—inking is considered a form of prayer.

### Sacred Sites

- River mouths where salt and fresh water meet—seen as gateways between worlds.

- Deep-sea trenches believed to be where the Stormmother sleeps when the waters are still.

### View of Outsiders & Rivalries

- They despise the works of **Aeltherion** for damming rivers, believing he “chains the veins of the Mother.”

- They see Azrakar’s flames as an insult to the sea’s cool, life-giving touch.


**Common Blessing:** _“May the tide lift your sails and the Mother guard your keel.”_

#### **The Hunt Eternal
[[Kharzun, the Dread Serpent]] 

### Core Beliefs
The Fang of Night is less a structured church and more a primal creed, passed down through the blood and bone of predators and warriors.

Followers see the world as an endless hunt where mercy is weakness and the strong alone are worthy of survival. 

To worship Kharzun is to embrace the raw, animalistic laws that ruled the world before the rise of cities and thrones.

### Beliefs & Practices

- **The Hunt as Truth** – All life is predator or prey; the hunt is the purest form of worship.

- **Blood as Offering** – Followers give sacrifices of hunted beasts—or enemies—letting the blood spill on soil or into water.

- **The Trial of Fangs** – To gain favor, one must prove dominance over a dangerous beast or rival.

- **Night Rites** – Worship often takes place under moonless skies, where the darkness is seen as Kharzun’s cloak.

#### **The Hidden Covenant
[[Arixael, the God Below]] 
#### Core Beliefs
The Veil of Nine is a clandestine, esoteric faith devoted to the God Below—Arixael, the keeper of the world’s most dangerous truths.

Followers believe that reality is a carefully maintained illusion, a facade crafted by lesser gods to keep mortals ignorant.

Arixael offers the keys to pierce this illusion, but each revelation transforms the seeker—sometimes physically, often irrevocably.

No public temples stand for the Veil. 

Worship is conducted in cellars, hidden chambers, and shadowed crossroads.

Its faithful wear masks, for identity is seen as a prison of the self, and anonymity is the first step toward transcendence.

### Beliefs & Practices

- **Truth in Darkness** – Illumination blinds; only in shadow can one see the world’s true form.

- **The Nine Trials** – Each initiate undergoes nine secretive rituals, one for each of Arixael’s runes, unlocking deeper layers of forbidden knowledge.

- Changelings and outcasts who have abandoned their birth identities.

### Holy Days

- **The Night Without a Name** – Once each year, the faithful abandon their given names for a full day, communicating only through gestures and symbols.

#### **The Ember Choir
[[Elaren, the Whispering Flame]] 

### Core Beliefs
The Ember Choir is a vibrant, volatile faith that worships Elaren, the Whispering Flame—muse of creators and midwife of revolutions.

Her followers believe that passion is the most sacred force in the cosmos, capable of igniting art, invention, and rebellion alike.

To them, the flame is not gentle warmth, but a living voice that urges mortals to _burn away stagnation_ and _set the world alight with vision_.

Worship is loud, colorful, and utterly unpredictable. 

The Ember Choir holds no fixed temples; instead, its gatherings erupt in taverns, workshops, marketplaces, and open plazas.

Murals, songs, street performances, and acts of open defiance against oppressive order are all considered holy offerings.

### Beliefs & Practices

- **The Spark Within** – Every soul carries a divine ember that can ignite creation or chaos.

- Inventors who break rules to spark progress.

### Holy Days

- **The Burning Verse** – Once a year, the faithful gather to create art in public and then set it aflame, symbolizing that creation lives on in memory, not in possession.

- **The Day of Sparks** – Marked by acts of joyful chaos, surprise performances, and declarations of love or revolution.

- Followers never speak of contracts; each kill is a “prayer.”

- Temples hidden in abandoned armories or catacombs.

- Worship through masks, perfume, and carefully constructed illusions.

- Temples double as theaters and pleasure houses.
